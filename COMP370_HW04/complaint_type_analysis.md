We discover that the main complaint in the first two months of the year is 
different than in June-July. These complaints are Heat/Hot Water and Noise-Residential
respectively. The difference might come from the fact that in winter, more people use heating
ad hot water than in summer which makes sense because it is colder so if there is an issue with
one of those, people are going to report it mroe. Further, in the summmer, people tend
to spend more time outdoors and have more gatherings, so it would make sense that there is generally
more noise in the summer than in the winter in residential areas.
